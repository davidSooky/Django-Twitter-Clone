# Twitter Clone built with Django and JavaScript
Functional Twitter Clona where you can make posts, upload images, comment on posts and customise your profile.

Like funcionality, searching for other peoples profiles and infinite scrolling is managed by an API built with Django Rest Framework.

So far only posting and commenting is working, making groups or chat functionality is not implemented.
